Usage
-----
```
g++ raytracer.cpp
# then...
./a.out
```

Libraries Used
-----
* cmath for mathematical operations.
* fstream for Input/output stream class to operate on files.
* stdio.h for terminal operations.

Implementation
-----
Ray tracing is a rendering technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light as pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects.
